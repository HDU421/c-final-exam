# Contributing guidelines

**This guideline has not been finished yet...**

**All hail our friendship!**

It is highly exciting to cooperate with all of you to create a project and grab high score in the final examination. But to make the development experience efficient and elegant, we need to reach an agreement about following some certain rules.

# Environment

## Compiler

We are using `gcc` to compile our project, which is widely used in other major open-source projects. Compared with `MSVC`, `gcc` provides better support with new standards.

## IDE

We are using `JetBrains CLion 2017` as our IDE (Integrated Development Environment). `CLion` comes with perfect support with GNU tools, such as `gcc`, `CMake` and `gdb`. You can retrieve a genuine copy of `CLion` for free using your educational email.
